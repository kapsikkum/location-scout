# API

Everything follows `INSTANCE_MODE` (see the README), apart from first-run setup and share-token reads.

## Core

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/auth/status` | Whether setup is needed, who's signed in, whether sign-up is open. |
| POST | `/api/auth/setup` | First run only: create the admin. |
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | Create a contributor account, if the admin allowed it. |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` / `/api/auth/logout` | Session cookie. |
| GET/POST | `/api/users` | Admin: list / create users. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Admin: change role or password, or remove a user. |
| GET/PUT | `/api/settings` | Home area, extra areas, sign-up toggle, remotes policy, feed URLs. PUT is admin-only. |
| GET | `/api/geocode?q=` | Nominatim search, cached. |
| GET | `/api/version` | Build info. |
| GET/POST | `/api/places` | List (visibility-filtered) / create. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/places/:id` | |
| GET/POST | `/api/spots` | `?bbox=s,w,n,e`, `?near=lat,lng&radiusKm=`, `?placeId=`. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/spots/:id` | `goodTimes` is validated: phases, months, days, conditions, event keywords, avoid, notes. |
| POST | `/api/spots/:id/photos` | Multipart `photo` + `thumb` (already resized in the browser); checked by magic bytes, capped at 15MB. |
| GET | `/api/photos/:id/file`, `/api/photos/:id/thumb` | Auth-checked against the parent spot's visibility. |
| GET | `/api/spots/:id/photos` | The spot's photos. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/photos/:id` | PATCH takes `caption` and `kind`. |
| POST | `/api/import` | A GeoJSON FeatureCollection of places/spots; upserts by `source`+`sourceRef` when both are given. |
| GET | `/api/export.geojson`, `/api/export.gpx` | Your own places/spots/sightings, or waypoints. |
| GET/POST | `/api/shares` | List / create a share link (returns a token). |
| DELETE | `/api/shares/:token` | Revoke. |
| GET | `/api/share/:token` | The bundle the token grants — no login needed, the token is the credential. |
| GET/POST | `/api/remotes` | List / add a remote instance's share URL. |
| DELETE | `/api/remotes/:id` | |
| POST | `/api/remotes/:id/sync` | Fetch and upsert now, instead of waiting for the daily task. |
| GET | `/api/tasks` | Background task status and log. |
| POST | `/api/tasks/:name/run` | Admin: run a task now. |

Remotes are SSRF-guarded: http(s) only, private/loopback/link-local addresses blocked unless `allowPrivateRemotes` is set (for LAN setups).

## Live feeds and ingestion

Same auth rules as above.
